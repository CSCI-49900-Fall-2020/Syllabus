## Course Description

This course is a chance for Computer Science majors to test their mettle on major projects. Working in small groups, you will implement systems that involve at least two tiers, at least one client, a rich RESTful API, and security aspects. 

## Projected Project Time Line

Day   | Date   | Task
----- | ------ | ----
3     | Sep 5  | Groups and projects must be finalized.
5     | Sep 12 | Group details due. This should contain a "group authored" section detailing what each group member is expecting to do.
9     | Oct 1  | Progress reports start. These should be roughly 10 minute presentations, one per group per week, delivered by a different member of the group each week.
28    | Dec 10 | Final demonstration of completely working project.
Final | Dec 17 | Final written report including your reflections on the project and the final demo and your evaluation of co-group-members.

## Prerequisite 

All non-elective courses in Computer Science required for graduation or permission of instructor.

## Grading

Grades will be based on a project, presentations, attendance, etc. The project, worth 35% of your grade, will involve programming a client-server distributed application. The server must support a RESTful web service. The client can be built on a technology of your choosing that supports the HTTP/S protocol and must communicate with the aforementioned server via REST calls. Moreover, there must be an aspect of security or privacy in your application, e.g., two-factor authentication or encrypted data. You will work with a team of 2 to 4 other students. This grade will be determined in part by my evaluation of the project and in part by your team members evaluation of your contribution. See the appendix for a complete description. Periodic presentations and written reports, reporting on tools and progress, will account for 55% of your grade. Professional presence (5%) and attendance (5%) will account for the rest of your grade.

Listed below is the complete breakdown:

| Area                                       | Percentage     |
|:---------------------------------------|:-----|
| Project                                | 35%  |
| Presentations (expect: 2 for progress) | 25%  |
| Written assignments (progress reports) | 20%  |
| Periodic peer reports                  | 5%   |
| Final peer report                      | 5%   |
| Professional presence                  | 5%   |
| Attendance                             | 5%   |
| Total                                  | 100% |

## Goals

There are two related goals for this class. The first is to assess the students’ mastery of the department’s stated learning goals. The second is to assess the department’s effectiveness in addressing these goals. For a complete list of these goals, see http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/csci/for-students/learning-goals-for-hunter-college-students.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected for *each and every class* meeting. Each student is allowed five (5) absences for any reason except on days when there are presentations or exams. Absences exceeding the allowance or absence on a presentation day for any reason results in a 0.2% deduction from the attendance grade.

## Academic Violations

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures. Special attention is given to CONTRACT CHEATING (this is where students have work completed on their behalf which is then submitted for academic credit).

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.

For additional information, you may call 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327) (voice). Individuals who use TDD may use the Federal Relay Service.

## Appendix A: Project grade

**NOTE**: This appendix is best viewed with something like [GitHub with MathJax](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-mathjax/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima).

The number you receive for your project grade is calculated as follows: Let ${\\cal G}$ be the set of people in your group, and *G* be the overall grade of the final project (a number between 0 and 30). Let $g\_{i,j}, i\\neq j, i,j\\in{\\cal G}$ be the grade *i* gives to *j*. Then *j*’s grade on the project is
$$G\_j =  G \\times \\sum\_{\\substack{i\\neq j\\\\i\\in{\\cal G}}}\\left(\\frac{g\_{i,j}}{\\sum\_{\\substack{i\\neq j\\\\j\\in {\\cal G}}} g\_{i,j}}\\right)$$
