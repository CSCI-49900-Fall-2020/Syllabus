## Course Description

This course is a chance for Computer Science majors to test their mettle on major projects. Working in small groups, you will implement systems that fulfill one of the [ICSE SCORE 2021][score] project [proposals] or one of the instructor's choosing. Student teams wishing to *enter* the contest must follow the instructions on the [SCORE CfP][cfp]. This includes *team registration* by no later than *Nov 30* and a summary report no later than *Jan 10*. **Note that the contest deadline is later than the course submission requirements**. This means that you *must* complete the project *prior to* the contest deadline, but all *documents* required by the contest may *not* be needed by the course deadline.

Note that the contest may require artifacts outside those required of our class. Also, students that have not taken CSCI 40500: Software Engineering may not be familiar with all of the artifacts, e.g., software requirements. Such students are welcome to ask the instructor for guest access to previous 40500 courses or may seek the advice of other students who have taken the course. Student teams not working on one of the [official SCORE topics][proposals], e.g., ones put forth by the instructor, may not officially enter the contest.

## Projected Project Timeline

Day   | Date   | Task
----- | ------ | ----
3     | Sep 4  | Groups and projects must be finalized.
5     | Sep 11 | Group details due. This should contain a "group authored" section detailing what each group member is expecting to do.
9     | Oct 1  | Progress reports start. These should be roughly 10 minute presentations, one per group per week, delivered by a different member of the group each week.
29    | Dec 8 | Final demonstration of completely working project.
Final | Dec 18 11:30-1:30 pm | Final written report including your reflections on the project and the final demo and your evaluation of co-group-members.

## Prerequisite 

All non-elective courses in Computer Science required for graduation or permission of instructor. 

## Textbook

There will be no textbook for this course.

## Grading

Grades will be based on a project, presentations, attendance, etc. The project, worth 35% of your grade, will implement one of the SCORE [proposals] or one of the instructor's choosing. Students may lobby the instructor to advocate for their own project proposals, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You will work with a **team of 3 to 5 other students**. This grade will be determined in part by my evaluation of the project and in part by your team members evaluation of your contribution. See the appendix for a complete description. Periodic presentations and written reports, reporting on tools and progress, will account for 55% of your grade. Professional presence (5%) and attendance (5%) will account for the rest of your grade.

Listed below is the complete breakdown:

| Area                                       | Percentage |
|:-------------------------------------------|:-----------|
| Project                                    | 35%        |
| Presentations (expect: 2 for progress)     | 25%        |
| Written assignments (progress reports)     | 20%        |
| Periodic peer reports                      | 5%         |
| Final peer report                          | 5%         |
| Professional presence                      | 5%         |
| Attendance                                 | 5%         |
| Total                                      | 100%       |

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR ยง 99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.

For additional information, you may call 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327) (voice). Individuals who use TDD may use the Federal Relay Service.

## Appendix A: Project Grade

**NOTE**: This appendix is best viewed with something like [GitHub with MathJax](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-mathjax/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima).

The number you receive for your project grade is calculated as follows: Let ${\\cal G}$ be the set of people in your group, and *G* be the overall grade of the final project (a number between 0 and 30). Let $g\_{i,j}, i\\neq j, i,j\\in{\\cal G}$ be the grade *i* gives to *j*. Then *j*โs grade on the project is
$$G\_j =  G \\times \\sum\_{\\substack{i\\neq j\\\\i\\in{\\cal G}}}\\left(\\frac{g\_{i,j}}{\\sum\_{\\substack{i\\neq j\\\\j\\in {\\cal G}}} g\_{i,j}}\\right)$$
